# No more InputName (and no more "case")

I had all the best intentions when first created the `case` command:
I would like to "sift" a stream with a clean syntax. But that kind of
naturally evolved into two other "support" things: the `InputName` atom
and *pattern matching*.

Not that these two are *inherently bad*, but now I feel they don't really
fit into the overall language. They ended up kind of "alien" compared to
all the rest.

Also, I'm trying to clean things up the best I can before introducing the
OOS (Object Orientation Stuff), so, all that (`InputName`, `case` and
pattern mathing) are gone, now.
